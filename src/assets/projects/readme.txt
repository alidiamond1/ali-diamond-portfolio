Project Screenshots Directory

This directory is for storing screenshots of your projects that will be displayed in the Projects section.

When you take screenshots of your projects, name them according to the following convention:
- mediamatch.jpg (or .png) - For the MediaMatch project
- tasktracker.jpg - For the TaskTracker Pro project
- somaliblog.jpg - For the SomaliBlog project
- predictor.jpg - For the Student Performance Predictor
- languagetutor.jpg - For the Somalia Language Tutor
- memorymatch.jpg - For the Memory Match Game

For best results, take screenshots with a 16:9 aspect ratio, and make sure they are at least 1280x720 pixels in resolution.

You can then update the imports in the ProjectImage.jsx component to point to your actual images.

Example:
```javascript
import mediamatchImg from '../assets/projects/mediamatch.jpg';
```
